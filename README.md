# optimParallel-python
A parallel computing interface to the L-BFGS-B optimizer.

A parallel version of the L-BFGS-B optimizer of `scipy.optimize.minimize()`.
Using it can significantly reduce the optimization time. For an objective
function with p parameters the optimization speed increases by up to
factor 1+p, when no analytic gradient is specified and 1+p processor cores
with sufficient memory are available.

A similar extension of the L-BFGS-B optimizer exists in the R package *optimParallel*:
